# Seveloper Story

##DESCRIPTION

In this game the user has been challenged with the task of developing a videogame by the ever-harrowing deadline of Tuesday.
The user will used their available choices of time management in order to overcome the obstacle of video-game development.
If the user does not complete their game by Tuesday OR loses too much Willpower, they will lose
If the user completes the game by the deadline they win.

###INTELLIGENCE/WILLPOWER/PROGRESS

Developer Story uses tree variables that the user will have to manage in order to sucessfully complete the videogame within the given time frame.

####INTELLIGENGE

Intelligence is the factor that effects how fast you are able to code your videogame. As your Intelligence gets higher, your productivity when using the "Code" command is increased. Each time you use the "Study" function you will increase your intelligence. The amount of intelligence increase the user experiences is dependent on how fatigued the player has become.

####WILLPOWER

Willpower is a character modifier that should not be taken lightly. The character's max willpower level is 100/100 where they are well rested, and the lowest point (and ending point of the game) is 0/100 where they decide to quit coding their videogame and begin working at taco-hut instead.
Taking actions such as "STUDY" and "CODE" will cause the player to lose a set amount of Willpower. The only way to regenerate willpower will be through the "REST" function.
If the player has below 60 willpower, they will begin to suffer negative consequences.

####PROGRESS

This percentage refers to how close you are to finishing your game. This is to serve as a remider of the user's progress.
Using the "Code" function will increase the progress bar by a varying amount
